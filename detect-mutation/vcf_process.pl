        are all from the two segregating groups and assign a symbol to each

        positive, set to x means no snp in the upstream x bp and downstream
        x bp of the indel, set to 0 means only remove snps overlapped with
        indels.

        "N" <= specified value
    --no-rare-ref
        skip loci where the "rare" allele is reference allele

        percentage of total loci(while n <= 1)

    --min-sample-depth <int>
    --max-sample-depth <int>
        samples with depth not within than this range will be treated as
        missing, DP or AD tag required
    --depth-file <filename>
        read sample depth filtering criteria from a file, the file
        should contain following rows
        
        "sample_id" "min_depth" "max_depth"

    --max-indel-len <int>
        filtering indels with size larger than this value
        
    *Note: for multi-allelic indel loci, the indel length refers to the
        largest allele length
        
        
Group Comparison Options:

    --segregating <strings>
        screen out loci which segregating alleles between two groups, groups
        should be specied here in the format:
        
        "Group1_1,Group1_2,Group1_3,...;Group2_1,Group2_2,Group2_3,..."
        
        can use an un-defined sample name in second group, thus the other
        samples would been determined only through comparison with the
        first group

Genotype manipulation Options:

    --overlap-gts
        screen out loci contain concordant GT fields in all samples
    
    --check-gt-depth
        make sure the genotype do have supporting reads, otherwise set them
        to missing
    --regenotype-hom <float>
        regnotype variants in homozygous samples according to the allele 
        depth calculated above, the homozygousity would be called only when 
        the minor allele count was less than the specified fraction of total 
        reliable mapped reads
    --regenotype-het <string>
        regnotype variants in heterozygous samples according to the calculated
        monior allele depth frequency, set a range here like 0.1,0.3, which
        indicates only minor allele depth frequency below the first threshold
        will be called as homozgyous, while frequency above second threshold
        will be called as heterozygous
    --gt-diff-as-missing
        do not actually regenotype those samples inconsistent with previous
        thresholds, but set those samples as missing instead
        
        
    --pseudo-as-missing
        set heterozygous alleles in homozygous samples to missing

    *Notes for Genotype counting:
        most of the genotype related operations require the present of
        covered depth for each allele, use AD field from GATK UnifiedGenotyper
        or HaplotyperCaller is recommand; while using NR and NV fields from
        Platypus, only bi-allelic loci will be processed as the NR field
        contains depths for each allele which could overlap each other

        
Clustering Options:

    --source-tag <string>
        tag of source type for each sample used to form blocks, can be set
        as "GT", "SC" or others, otherwise will use all sample field as
        the source type

    --fill-gaps
        trying to fill gaps between fragments, the original blocks with
        continuous markers were treated as fragments here, regions with no
        markers or failed to pass minimum threshold required for a reliable
        fragment would be treated as gaps, those gaps will be filled as
        describled below:
        
        merged into flanking fragments while they are in same type or
        merged by extending flanking fragments while they are in different
        types, e.g.
            AAAAAAAAAAAAXXXXAAAAAAAAAAA => AAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaAAAAAAAAAAA
            AAAAAAAAAAAAXXXXBBBBBBBBBBB => AAAAAAAAAAAAaabbBBBBBBBBBBB
        final results also extend to regions with no markers, which use a
        half-half rule to split into flanking blocks
        
        
    --min-frag-length   <int>
        minimum length of a fragment
    --min-frag-markers  <int>
        minimum number of markers in a fragment
    --min-frag-density  <float>
        minimum fraction of markers in a fragment
        
        Those three options are used to determine whether a fragment will be
        treated as "seeds" which used to extend, or "gaps" which need to be
        filled
        
    --min-major-perc    <float>
        blocks with (major markers / total markers) * 100 less than this value
        will be annotated as "Complex"
    --min-block-density <float>
        blocks with (total markers / block length) smaller than this value will
        be annotated as "LowDensity"
        
        Those two options only add tags to output
    
    *********************** deprecated options ***********************
    --type2char <string>
        specify symbols to overide default set, in the format:
        "Source_A:A;Source_B:B;...", required
    --char2type <string>
        reverse convert chars to types, in the format:
        "A:Source_A;B:Source_B;...",
        default will use the reverse of the values "--type2char" set
    
    --fill-trans <string>
        fill gaps between different types of fragments (denoted as transfrom
        regions here) using certain specified character instead of previous
        "half-half" rule, character set here must have a correspond type
        defind in "--type2char" option
    
    *Notes for deprecated options:
        The last three options were only remained for backward compatiblity,
        which use an old string match clustering algorithm, that is
        magnitudes slower than current used one, and could also cause the
        memory to run out if too much samples is given, thus is deprecated
        currently;
        However, if you do want to use the old algorithm, also be cautious
        characters from "X" to "Z" is reserved for special use, do not set
        those characters unless you known what you're doing.
    ******************************************************************


Combine Options:
    
    --primary-tag   <string>
        Tag used for records only from master vcf file in combined vcf file,
        default: Primary
    --secondary-tag <string>
        Tag used for records only from secondary vcf file in combined vcf
        file, default: Secondary
    --intersect-tag <string>
        Tag used for intersection records in combined vcf file,
        default: Intersection

    --combine-rows  <numbers>
        Specify rows (0-based) used as master compare keys, these rows
        determine whether two records are same (intersection) or not (primary
        or secondary), the CHROM and POS rows should always be specified,
        default only use CHROM and POS fields (e.g. 0 1)
    
    --compare-rows  <numbers>
        Specify rows (0-based) used as sub compare keys, records with same
        combine rows but different compare rows would be merged and a SDIFF
        tag would be added
        
    *Note: if original vcf files to be combined contain duplicate records,
        combined set would contain a "pseudo-union" set of those records, one
        need to double check those loci


Other Options:

    --threads  <int>
        how many data threads should be allocated to running this analysis,
        currently only valid while doing clustering [default: 1]
        
    *Note:
        1) As forking new thread is relatively expensive, using multiple
        threads on simple jobs could cost more time, thus this option is only
        suggested while doing processes such as fill gaps, which contains
        steps much more time consuming;
        2) Currently clustering process if much faster, threading is thus
        unnecessary.

    --sum-diagnose
        indicate input vcf file is from GATK DiagnoseTargets, output will be
        summary of those diagnose results
        
    
    --check-context
        check sequence context within or around variants loci
    --extend-snp    <int>
        extend regions to inspect flanking sequence context for SNPs
        [default: 5bp]
    --extend-indel  <int>
        extend regions to inspect flanking sequence context for INDELs
        [default: 10bp]

    *Notes for context checking:
        1) Only bi-allelic loci is supported while analysis sequence context,
        one needs to break multi-alleles into multi bi-allele records before
        using this function;
        2) Extension here is different for SNPs and INDELs, e.g. upstream
        5bp and downstream 5bp for SNPs, while only downstream 10bp for
        INDELs, thus the INDELs are assumed to be already left aligned
